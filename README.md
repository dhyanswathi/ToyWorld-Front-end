# ToyWorld
 
 Toyworld is an app for toy exchange. Here you can buy and sell preloved toys.
 
 ## Scenario
During my days in </salt> bootcamp, we had a personal hack day. We had to create a full-stack application in one day. I was brainstorming for ideas and decided to address a real life problem. <br/>
      Being a parent, one of the challenges I am facing is, my kid getting bored of his toys. Our house is filled with a million toys and he still want new ones. It was costing us money and space. Thats how i came up with this idea of toy swapping.
